Semantic search is a search technique that aims to understand the meaning behind a user's query and the content of web pages, rather than relying solely on matching keywords. It incorporates natural language processing, machine learning, and other technologies to comprehend the context and intent of the search query.
Semantic search improves search accuracy in several ways:

1.Contextual understanding: It analyzes the query in relation to the broader context, including user location, search history, and personal preferences, to provide more relevant results.

2.Entity recognition: It recognizes and understands entities such as people, places, organizations, and events, allowing for more precise search results.

3.Conceptual matching: It identifies the underlying concepts and themes within the query and content, enabling a deeper understanding of the user's intent and retrieving information that may not contain exact keyword matches.

4.Synonym recognition: It recognizes synonyms and related terms to expand the search scope and retrieve relevant information even if the exact terms are not used.

5.Natural language processing: It leverages language understanding capabilities to interpret and process queries written in natural language, facilitating more accurate retrieval of information.

6.User intent recognition: It focuses on understanding the user's intent behind the search query, enabling the search engine to provide more personalized and targeted results.

7.Overall, semantic search enhances search accuracy by going beyond keyword matching and taking into account the user's context, intent, and the actual meaning of the query and web content.
